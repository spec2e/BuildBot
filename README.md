#Synopsis

This is an example of a more complete Sametime bot than what you would find in the IBM page. It includes the ability of executing plugins as commands, so it is made to be extensible.

This project is released in the hopes that it will useful to others as a base example on how to do their own bot. It comes with no warranties and it is not being actively developed.


#Usage

There is a config file in "resource/config.properties". It has the properties to set up the account user name, password and server which are needed so that the bot can login into sametime.

The project can be run by executing: ant run

For distribution a jar can be created as such: ant jar
